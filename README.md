This project is an application project. Everyday there are lots of stray animals
on streets which suffer or get killed humanely in shelters around the world. We
could think that if a nice picture of these animals are available it would develop
more interest to the people and they can adopt it faster. But the question is
what is a good picture. What are the traits that define a good picture and how
we can identify it. To answer these questions we would need effective machine
learning models, training and testing the models on different sets of images for
predicting and analyzing the research questions mentioned above. PetFinder.my
is a animal welfare platform that currently uses a basic cuteness meter to rank
the pet photos. While this tool seems to be useful there are lots of improvements
that could be made and this functionality is still in experimental stage. This
project is for that welfare platform.

Since in this project we need to find out is the picture nice enough to gain interest
it looks more like a image classification problem. Basically in image classification
the images are segmented into different categories based on features. The features
will be like pixel intensity, change in pixel values, color composition, background
color and many more. For implementing this kind of problem I am planning
to use the Convolution Neural network model which is a part of Deep Learning
model. The reason for using this model is because it assigns importance to various
aspects of the image and helps in differentiating one another.
